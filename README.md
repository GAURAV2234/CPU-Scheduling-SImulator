# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
This is a Java-based CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator, designed to explore and compare the unique characteristics of different CPU scheduling algorithms. The choice of which algorithm to apply in a specific scenario depends on various criteria, known as CPU scheduling criteria, which may prioritize response time, throughput, or average waiting time. Our project aims to address the challenge of determining the most suitable scheduling algorithm for a given situation.

The CPU Scheduling Simulator provides an environment for users to experimentally evaluate the performance of each algorithm through simulation. Users can select their preferred scheduling algorithm at the beginning of the program and then input details for a set of processes, including CPU burst, process ID, priority (if priority scheduling is chosen), arrival time, and more. This allows users to observe process execution, monitor remaining wait/burst times, and track processes in the ready queue. Notably, the project features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI), enhancing ease of use and convenience.
